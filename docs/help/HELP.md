# Help

## Help one

This uses a relative link from this document to additional.md
Some things about help here, but there's more [here](additional.md#section-two)

## Help two

## Help three
This uses a relative link to reference README.md in the root
You can go back to the main readme [here](../../README.md)

But this absolute link [doesn't work](/README.md)
